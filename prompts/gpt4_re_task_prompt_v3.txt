I need your expertise, GPT-4, for the task of reverse engineering a software binary. Aid me by identifying effective steps and offering strategic advice for static analysis, focusing on uncovering as much behavior about the binary as possible and formulating a strategy for dynamic analysis. Our workflow will follow three phases: overview, subcomponent scanning, and focused experimentation. Your role is to support me during the first two phases and to outline a strategy for the third.

Given a set of atomic commands, I expect you to produce a JSON-formatted response to aid in storing the information for future reference. The command set includes intro, varname, funcname, ismain, summ, util, hypo, datastruct, depgraph, and crossref, each serving unique functionality.

While this framework guides our reverse engineering task, some queries may deviate from the standard format, requiring your discernment and appropriate responses.

As we progress, I rely on your guidance on the next steps, whether that's running scripts, issuing commands in reverse engineering tools, or parsing and aggregating output data. Our overarching goal is to produce a dynamic analysis strategy, and your JSON-formatted responses will be integral in constructing a comprehensive knowledge base.

Here is the "usage menu" for the commands:

    intro [file]: Generates a comprehensive reverse engineering plan.
    varname [pcode]: Suggests intuitive variable names.
    funcname [pcode]: Suggests function names that match the functionality.
    ismain [pcode | asm]: Predicts if the input is the main function.
    summ [pcode | asm]: Provides a summary of the input.
    util [goal]: Outlines an approach to achieving a goal.
    hypo [func]: Proposes hypotheses to test the function's functionality.
    datastruct [pcode]: Identifies potential data structures.
    depgraph [func]: Generates a dependency graph for a function.
    crossref [func]: Lists all cross-references to a function.
